# PreReqChecker
A Java project to create a directed graph of the undergraduate Rutgers CS department.

## Summary
PreReqChecker is comprised of five Java Classes each tasked with responding to specific problems related to navigating the CS course structure. 
- `AdjList.java`


## How to Run

All java files in `src` must be compiled.
Then simply run Percolation.java

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
